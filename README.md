# Coursera_Capstone
Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Certification

This project is an attempt to define where light rail service could/should be expanded to in the Phoenix metro area. Through the use of US Census data, Valley Metro data, and the Foursquare API, I was able to define areas with high population and walkable venue density - ideal candiates for light rail service in the future. All of this data is plotted via Folium. 

Analysis was conducted entirely within a Jupyter notebook. A Microsoft Word report and PowerPoint presentation are also included.

Also included are the final assignments from the course - analysis of Toronto neighborhoods - these are not related to the main project and are only included to satisfy course requriements.
