Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Certification

This project is an attempt to define where light rail service could/should be expanded to in the Phoenix, Arizona metro area. Through the use of US Census data, Valley Metro data, and the Foursquare API, I was able to define areas with high population and walkable venue density - ideal candiates for light rail service in the future. All of this data is plotted via Folium. 

Analysis was conducted entirely within a Jupyter notebook. A Microsoft Word report and PowerPoint presentation are also included.

Based on this work, two new light rail lines were plotted to help connect the most dense/most venue-heavy areas in the Phoenix metro area. I believe these lines would help connect some of the most desireable parts of town and would increase non-commuter ridership. The second benefit is imperitive for the successful growth of public transit in the area - the current light rail system is set up to bring commuters to downtown Phoenix from other parts of the city in a hub-and-spoke system.

I know the real world planning is considerably more complicated than I have made it out to be in this project. That said, I hope my research will in some way contribute to better planning and more success for the light rail system in Phoenix.
